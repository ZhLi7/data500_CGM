# AIREADI — CGM Final Project

This repository contains a small sample of AIREADI study data and the supporting code used to produce the final project deliverables, including participant-level summaries and CGM time-series figures.

Repository Layout
	•	participants.Rmd — R Markdown file that produces the final HTML report (tables + figures).
	•	participants.html — Generated HTML output (built via the Makefile).
	•	data/ — Input study data:
	•	participants.tsv
	•	clinical_data/
	•	CGM JSON files under: wearable_blood_glucose/continuous_glucose_monitoring/dexcom_g6/
	•	codes/ — Supporting scripts:
	•	cgm_plots.R — R script that loads Dexcom JSON and generates CGM time-series PNGs.
	•	outputs/ — Generated PNG figures created by cgm_plots.R.

Quick Goals and What Produces Each Output

Final Report (tables + static figures)

Generated from participants.Rmd, including:
	•	Participant-level availability summary (avail_summary)
	•	Study-group summary table (sg_tbl)

Required CGM Figures (example time series)

Generated by codes/cgm_plots.R, saved to:

outputs/{participant_id}.png

How to Reproduce the Entire Report

From the repository root:

make

or explicitly:

make report

What the Makefile Does
	•	make figures
	•	Runs: Rscript codes/cgm_plots.R
	•	Creates all CGM PNGs in outputs/
	•	make report
	•	Runs make figures first
	•	Then renders:

participants.Rmd → participants.html


	•	make clean
	•	Deletes generated HTML and PNGs

⸻

Notes and Assumptions
	•	Plots use participant_id as labels (no participant names available).
	•	Metadata (age, study_group) comes from data/participants.tsv.
	•	participants.Rmd uses the following R packages:
tidyverse, janitor, readr, knitr, kableExtra, scales, lubridate, glue, here.
	•	Missing packages are installed automatically when the Rmd is rendered.
	•	cgm_plots.R assumes the working directory is the repository root and writes figures to outputs/.

⸻

Customization
	•	To change which participants are plotted:
Edit codes/cgm_plots.R (defaults to first seven participants).
	•	To point the report to different data:
Modify the file paths inside participants.Rmd.
